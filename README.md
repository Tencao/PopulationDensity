PopulationDensity
=================

PopulationDensity v3.9+ (Since Luficer, aka OffLuffy took over)

This is quite a re-write compared to the previously released version of PopulationDensity.

Primary difference being that I re-arranged several classes into packages and I'd like to
think that I've cleaned up the code quite a bit so far. Also tried to shorten certain bits
of repetative code blocks into single methods, as well as various other code changes.

Other than that, features changed so far includes:
- Better permission support via Vault
- Colored sign text on region posts
- Stand-alone teleport signs
- New /listregions command
- Adjusted region spawn location (Added 2 to Z coord to not spawn on glowstone)

I'll put a change-log in here somewhere I'm sure. This is just a few notable changes

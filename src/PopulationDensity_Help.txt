Last Updated: August 3, 2013

This file is to go over some of the config options and in-game functions of PopulationDensity!
It occurred to me that despite the verbosity of the config options, they may not be entirely
straight-forward or understandable, so this is an attempt to help with that issue! This file
will only generate on installation (when it creates the 'PopulationDensityData' folder)

ABOUT THE PLUGIN!
	PopulationDensity was originally written by bigscary.
	It does NOT spawn players 'randomly' on the map!
	This plugin aims to prevent common problems on high-traffic servers such as:
		> No resources around spawn
		> Spawning too far from your home
		> Crowding around your spawn point
		> Entity counts being too high (mob grinders, etc)
		
HOW IT DOES THIS!
	PD seeks to deal with such problems by creating 'regions', which are regularly scanned
	in configurable intervals and on server reload/restart for resources and 'crowdedness'.
	When PD is installed, an initial scan will determine which region will be 'opened', meaning
	that new-to-server players will spawn there. Note that this can take a long time! Especially
	for maps which have been played on for a while, since PD may then need to scan additional
	regions to find a suitable one!
	
	Players with permission may also move in to other regions closer to thier houses and teleport
	to thier home region, and even random regions. The helps thin out crowds quite effectively.
	
	For entity counts, regions can be scanned in configurable intervals and remove excess entities.
	Entity limits per chunk (not region!) can be specified in the config as well.
	
REGION NAMES (regionNames.txt)!
	The regionNames.txt file is a list of names that PopulationDensity will choose from when
	naming a new region. The names on this list should be less than 10 letters long. If a name
	is selected that is longer, PD will truncate excess letters and only use the first 10. If the
	names list is empty, PD will also use a default list built in (which is the same one that is
	generated in the file on first-run). There currently is no limit to the number of names on the
	list, but know that an insanely long list (like thousands of name), may affect the plugin's
	performance since this list is stored in memory! Each name should be on a new line and should not
	contain spaces (they will be removed if any are found).
	
	The name selection process is semi-random in such a way that allows the names in the list to
	stay in whatever order suits you, but PD will choose from the list randomly. But it's not entirely 
	random since PD has to select names in a certain order to detect if all names have been used (in which
	case, new region names will have a number appended to it). For the curious (not important), PD chooses
	randomly by generating a list of numbers equal to the length of the name list, each number referencing
	a name in the list. This list of numbers is then scrambled, then this scrambled list is used to pick
	names. The numbers are scrambled on each server start and reload.
	
CONFIGURATION OPTIONS (config.yml)!
	The config.yml is stored in /plugins/PopulationDensityData and can be edited in any text
	editor. The config is broken into sections for readability. Below in a description of each option:
	
		> Worlds Section
			> ManagedWorld
				> The name of the world that you want PopulationDensity to take effect in. There
				  can currently only be one world specified. By default this is 'world'. Note that
				  this must be set to a valid world name or the plugin will disable itself.
			> CityWorld
				> The 'City World' is the world that new players will spawn into rather than the
				  opened region. This can be used for Tutorials or centralized spawn. Afterwards,
				  players will respawn in home region if the config option 'RespawnInHomeRegion' is true.
				  By default, this is blank ('')
		> Spawning Section
			> NewPlayerSpawnInHomeRegion
				> Bypasses the CityWorld option and spawns new players in the open region.
			> RespawnInHomeRegion
				> Spawns players in thier home region when they respawn, rather than the city world spawn
		> Teleporting Section
			> AllowTeleportation
				> If false, disables all teleporting that PopulationDensity provides, such as /homeregion,
				  /randomregion, /newestregion, etc, unless the player has permission to bypass this option.
				  Default Value: true
			> TeleportFromAnywhere
				> Allows players to teleport from other areas that are not close to region posts. This can
				  be achieved per-player with the 'populationdensity.teleportanywhere' permission.
				  Default Value: false
			> PostTeleportRadius
				> If TeleportFromAnywhere is disabled, this option specifies how close a player must be
				  to a region post in order to use PD's teleport commands.
				  Default Value: 25
			> TeleportViaPostSigns
				> If enabled, allows players to right-click on direction signs generated on region posts
				  to teleport to the appropriate region indicated on the sign.
				  Default Value: false
			> TeleportViaOtherSigns
				> If enabled, allows players to right-click on standalone teleport signs create by users
				  with permission to create them. A standalone teleport sign is formatted as such:
				  SIGN:   ------------------
				  Line 1: |    [Region]    |  \  These top two lines are NOT case-sensitive, but the
				  Line 2: |   RegionName   |  /  top lines DOES require brackets!
				  Line 3: |                |  \  The bottom two lines are blank. Any text here will
				  Line 4: |                |  /  be removed!
				          ------------------
		> Scanning Section
			> HoursBetweenResourceScans
				> The number of hours between region score scans. This scan will re-calculate the region's
				  score based on the number of near-surface resources and crowded-ness to determine if the
				  region is still suitable for new players to spawn.
			> DensityRatio
				> This number adjusts how many player blocks must be present in a region during a region scan
				  before the region is no longer considered suitable.
			> LimitEntities
				> If enabled, PD will remove excessive entities (Monsters, Animals, Villagers, and Item Drops)
				  during entity scans. Refer to the ChunkLimits section for the configurable entity limits.
				  Unlike the resource scans, entity scans are not confined to a region, but will include
				  all chunks currently loaded on the server.
			> HoursBetweenEntityScans
				> The number of hours between scanning all loaded chunks for excessive entities.
		> ChunkLimits (Note that these limits are PER CHUNK, and not per region! Chunk = 16x16 blocks)
			> MaximumAnimalsPerChunk
				> The maximum number of animals (such as cows, pigs, sheep, etc) that can be present in a
				  chunk before PD begins to remove excessive animals. Note that these limits do NOT
				  discriminate between a player's farm animals and wild animals. Setting this number too
				  low could adversely affect player farms!
			> MaximumMonstersPerChunk
				> The maximum number of monsters (such as creepers, spiders, etc) that can be present in a
				  chunk before PD begins to remove excessive monsters.
			> MaximumVillagersPerChunk
				> The maximum number of villagers that can be present in a chunk before PD begins to remove
				  excessive villagers.
			> MaximumDropsPerChunk
				> The maximum number of item drops that can be present in a chunk before PD begins to remove
				  excessive item drops.
		> Queueing Section
			> MaxIdleMinutes
				> The number of minutes that a player can idle before being kicked from the game
			> LoginQueueEnabled
				> Enable queueing. This will help manage how a players connections when the server is full.
			> MinimumPlayersOnlineForIdleBoot
				> The number of players that must be online before PD will begin kicking players for idling
			> ReservedSlotsForAdministrators
				> How many slots to reserver for admins. When there are only this many slots left, non-admin
				  ranked players will not be allowed to join, ensuring that admins can connect during rush-hour
			> LoginQueueMessage
				> The message that is shown to users attempting to connect when they are disconnected. This will
				  only display if LoginQueueEnabled is true.
		> Misc Section
			> GrassRegrows
				> If true, when an animal spawns, PD will change dirt blocks to grass around the animal.
			> AnimalsRespawn
				> If true, PD will spawn additional animals when a monster spawns. There is a rare chance that
				  PD will spawn a group of animals rather than a single animal.
			> TreesRegrow
				> If true, PD will plant a sapling in the location that a sapling drop despawns.
			> PrintResourceScanResults
				> If true, PD will log to console the results of resource scans. The results are shown on a
				  per-region basis. A resource scan will NOT scan the entire map.
			> PrintEntityScanResults
				> If true, PD will log to console the results of entity scans. The numbers reflected in the
				  entity scan results is the total number of entites that were found and removed, not just the
				  number per chunk. Results are printed in the following format:
				  	  > MobType ... TotalFound / TotalAllowed (How many were removed)
		> Regions Section
			> BuildRegionPosts
				> If true, PD will generate a post structure in the center of each region, including wilderness
				  regions. Posts are generated 10 seconds after a chunk containing a post is loaded.
			> MinimumRegionPostY
				> This is the minimum height that a region post will generate. This ensures that a post will not
				  generate at the bottom of a ravine or ocean. This number may need to be tweaked if using custom
				  map generators or the vanilla flat terrain.
			> PostProtectionRadius
				> The radius in which players will not be allowed to build around the region posts. Note that this
				  is not a circular radius for the sake of speed. Only players with the 'populationdensity.buildbreakanywhere'
				  permission will be allowed to build or break the region posts, but the central post (not including the radius)
				  will regenerate with each chunk load, or with the /addregionpost command.
			> CustomSigns
				> These options allow you to specify the text to display on the signs of the region post. If these are left blank,
				  custom signs will not generate. Note that the Main sign is the sign on the top of the post, whereas the
				  directional signs will be placed on the bottom.
		> WorldGuardOptions
			> ClaimRegionPosts
				> If this is enabled AND WorldGuard is available on the server, PD will automatically claim the
				  area around the region post IF there are no claims already there. This claim will encompass the
				  region post and the PostProtectionRadius.
			> PreventPostsOnClaims
				> If this is enabled AND WorldGuard is available on the server, PD will prevent the generation
				  of a region's posts if the post and PostProtectionRadius intersects an existing WorldGuard claim.
		> GriefPreventionOptions
			> ClaimRegionPosts
				> If this is enabled AND GriefPrevention is available on the server, PD will automatically claim the
				  area around the region post IF there are no claims already there. This claim will encompass the
				  region post and the PostProtectionRadius.
			> PreventPostsOnClaims
				> If this is enabled AND GriefPrevention is available on the server, PD will prevent the generation
				  of a region's posts if the post and PostProtectionRadius intersects an existing GriefPrevention claim.

THINGS TO KNOW!
	What is a region, exactly?
		> A region is a 400x400 meter (block) area which has a 'score' which determines how
		  suitable a region is for new players. The more player blocks or the fewer 'near-surface'
		  resources a region has will lower it's score. Any non-wilderness regions will be named
		  and can be renamed later with the /nameregion command. A region can be re-scanned at
		  any time as well with the /scanregion command. If a region score drops too low, a new
		  region will start to be scanned in search of a new resourceful area.
	Why can't I change that a region is 400x400 meters?
		> Simply put, making variable region sizes would introduce several new problems. Namely, old
		  region data files would need to be discarded. If region posts were enabled, changing region
		  sizes would cause potentially several dead region posts. Such a simple thing could entirely
		  destroy all the region data previously stored on the server.
	Are players required to build in regions?
		> In a way, yes. Regions will cover the entirety of the map, but players do NOT need to build
		  in scanned or named regions. Un-named regions are called Wilderness regions. Players are also
		  free to build in these regions, which will already have a name-less region post if posts are
		  enabled, since region posts generate as new chunks are loaded.
	Why do the region scan results hardly ever contain rare ores?
		> PD will only attempt to scan for 'near-surface' resources. Mostly trees and common ores. Other
		  ores have more weight on the region score, but unless they are 'easily accessible', PD will
		  not count it towards the region's resource score. Those ores must still counted because
		  other map generators may change where ores are generated, affecting the resource scores.
